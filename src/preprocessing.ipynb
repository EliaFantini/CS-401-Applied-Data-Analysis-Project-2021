    "### Getting politicians dataset\n",
    "To obtain a dataset of politicians' quotations, we need to enrich the original *Quotebank* dataset with additional information about the speakers' political affiliations. To achieve that, we propose a preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, load the *Wikidata* table from the `.parquet` file (provided on the *Quotebank*'s Google Drive). Keep the columns containing information interesting for us - speaker's QID and label, and party's QID, discard the others and drop the rows with missing values. Convert that to a `pandas DataFrame` and dump it into a `.pickle` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each of the years load the initial *Quotebank* data. The initial dataset is represented as a list of `json` objects - process it into a `DataFrame` in a line-by-line manner, only keeping the quotation content and QID, as well as the speaker's QID. Dump the dataframe into a `.pickle` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, perform an inner join between the two dataframes on the speaker QID - that way you end up with a dataframe containing quotations, along with information about the speaker's political affiliation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The *Quotebank* dataset is divided into batches based on the quotation date - 6 files are corresponding to years from 2015 until 2020. Therefore we perform the pipeline explained above 6 times, and then merge the results into a single dataframe. We end up with a dataset of around 17m quotations."
